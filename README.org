* dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Managed with Nix Flake.

** Installation

Currently my dotfiles are adapted for three kinds of OSes: NixOS, macOS and
Ubuntu. The configurations are divided into two parts: system-wide and
user-wide. You can install these two parts individually.

Before installation, at least make sure you've installed =git=, =curl= and
=make=. If you are on Ubunut, =./scripts/init-ubuntu= can help you do that.

Install system-wide configuration:

#+begin_src sh
# Depending on which OS you are on.
make init-nixos
make init-darwin
make init-ubuntu
#+end_src

Install user-wide configuration:

#+begin_src sh
make init-home
#+end_src

Or, if you only want to install Nix as a package manager:

#+begin_src sh
make install-nix
#+end_src

which utilizes the [[https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer][nix-installer from DeterminateSystems]].

NOTE:

- ~make init-home~ only affects user-level configurations. Therefore, it even
  does not require "sudo", as long as you have correctly installed Nix. As a
  result, it won't change the user's default shell which needs to touch the
  system file ~/etc/passwd~. You may manually set the default with chsh(1). This
  fact matters when you want to install my dotfiles on Ubuntu.
